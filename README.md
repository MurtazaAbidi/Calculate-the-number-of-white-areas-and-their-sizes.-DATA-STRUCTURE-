# Calculate-the-number-of-white-areas-and-their-sizes.-DATA-STRUCTURE-

An n × n square consists of black and white cells arranged in a certain way. 
The problem is to determine the number of white areas and the number of white cells in each area.
For example, a regular 8 × 8 chessboard has 32 one-cell white areas; the square in Figure 5.22a consists of 10 areas, 2 of them of 10 cells, and 8 of 2 cells; 
the square in Figure 5.22b has 5 white areas of 1, 3, 21, 10, and 2 cells. 

Write a program that, for a given n × n square, outputs the number of white areas  and their sizes. Use an (n + 2) × (n + 2) array with properly marked cells. 
Two ad- ditional rows and columns constitute a frame of black cells surrounding the entered  square to simplify your implementation. 
For instance, the square in Figure 5.22b is stored as the square in Figure 5.22c.
